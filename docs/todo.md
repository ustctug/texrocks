# Future

## Features

- [x] install packages in parallel, thanks to lx
- [x] package version control, thanks to rockspec
- [x] virtual environment, thanks to lx
- [x] minimal preinstalled packages
- [x] no extra dependencies while TeXLive needs perl, tcl/tk, ...
- [x] support Unix
- [ ] support Win32. We use shebang so a cmd wrapper is needed
- [x] a server to host packages: <https://ustctug.github.io/texrocks/>

## TODO

- read `~/.config/lux/config.toml` to know real installed TeX files's paths.
